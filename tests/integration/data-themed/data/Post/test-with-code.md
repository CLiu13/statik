title: Test post with some code
---

This should test the codehilite integration.

    :::python
    print("Hello world!")

And now some more code, but in a different language:

    :::c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        printf("Hello world!\n");
        return 0;
    }
